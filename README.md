TidePrediction
==============
Tide Prediction is a couple of Bash scripts showing today's tide data for several California beaches. It uses the xtide program to generate the tide prediction data. The main script is tide.sh. I use cron to run generate.sh every 4 hours to update the tide data. Data are stored in *.txt files for display. The PHP and Bash scripts were written by me. Xtide is open-source GNU General Public License.
